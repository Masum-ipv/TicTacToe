# Description
In order to make the game unbeatable, it was necessary to create an algorithm that could calculate all the possible moves available for the computer player and use some metric to determine the best possible move. After extensive research it became clear that the Minimax [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) was right for the job.
